Throughout most of the 20th century, the Black Rhino was the most numerous of the world's rhino species. Relentless hunting of the species and clearances of land for settlement and agriculture reduced numbers and by 1960 only an estimated 100,000 remained.

Between 1960 and 1995, large-scale poaching caused a dramatic 98% collapse in numbers with numbers bottoming out in the mid 1990s. Over this period numbers only increased in South Africa and Namibia (Emslie and Brooks 1999). From 1992–1997 total numbers remained relatively stable with increases in some countries (those with the best-protected and managed populations) being cancelled out by declines in others. However, since the lows of the mid-1990s, Black Rhino numbers at a continental level have more than doubled reaching and estimated 5,495 by end 2017 (Emslie et al. 2019) and 5,630 by end 2018 (Knight 2019). Figure 1 in the attached Supplementary Information documentation shows how estimated total numbers of Black Rhino have changed over the last three-generations based on best estimates of rhino numbers per subspecies per country per year going back three-generations to 1973.

Black Rhino occur in a wide variety of habitats from desert areas in Namibia to wetter wooded areas. The highest densities of rhinos are found in savannas on nutrient-rich soils and in succulent Valley Bushveld areas.

Black Rhino are browsers and favour small acacia's and other palatable woody species (Grewia's, Euphorbiaceae species, etc.) as well as palatable herbs and succulents. However, because of high levels of secondary plant chemicals, much woody plant browse (especially many evergreen species) in some areas is unpalatable. Failure to appreciate this, has in the past led to carrying capacities being over-estimated in some areas. Apart from plant species composition and size structure, Black Rhino carrying capacity is related to rainfall, soil nutrient status, fire histories, levels of grass interference, extent of frost and densities of other large browsers. To maintain rapid population growth rates and prevent potential habitat damage if the population overshoots carrying capacity, populations of Black Rhinos should be managed at densities below long term ecological carrying capacity (i.e., below zero growth densities). Surplus rhino that are removed from such established populations are routinely being profitably invested in new areas with suitable habitat and protection where populations can grow rapidly.

There is significant population genetic differentiation between all three extant subspecies of Black Rhinoceros (hereafter Black Rhino) recognised by the IUCN SSC African Rhinoceros Specialist Group (AfRSG) (Harley et al. 2005), and the differences are consistent with them being considered subspecies although it is unlikely that outbreeding depression would occur in any mix of these populations (E. Harley pers. comm. 2016).

Subsequent classification analyses of RhoDIS DNA samples (originally undertaken primarily for forensic purposes) also strongly supported use of the current three surviving subspecies classification at a continental level. It also indicated that Diceros bicornis minor samples could be further subdivided into those of Zambesi, KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) or mixed Zambesi/KZN origin (Emslie 2018, Harper et al. 2018). Moodley et al. (2017) also found this partitioning of D. b. minor. The populations founded with KZN animals were found to be less genetically diverse than ones derived from Zambesi animals due to a relatively recent severe bottleneck (Emslie 2018, Harper et al. 2018). Data indicates that most of the genetic diversity has been recovered in the large mixed KZN/Zambesi founded population in the Kruger National Park (C. Harper pers. comm. 2018).
